# Discordjs v14 Musicbot Guide

## Introduction
Hello! This guide will try to simplify the complexity of making a discord bot, If you have any questions after reading this guide, please don't hesitate to ask me for.

## Pre-requisite software

Depending on the operating system you're running the installation will be slightly different.

* nodejs \(Version 16.6 and higher required, see [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)\)
* erelajs ([Website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/erela.js) / `npm i erela.js`)

Once you have this all installed, create a folder for your project and install discord.js:

## Launching the bot

In your command prompt, from inside the folder where `index.js` is located, launch it with:
